## MixinComponentFormula

The code defines a mixin component for a math formula editor in JavaScript. It includes props
for the node, updateAttributes function, and editor object, as well as data for various properties
such as whether the element is ready, whether the edit modal is open, the LaTeX data, and more. It
also includes computed properties, watchers, and methods for handling keyboard events, loading
MathLive, checking for errors in the formula, and more.


```javascript
const MixinComponentFormula = {}         
```

## computedKatex()

This function renders a purified version of a given KaTeX expression as a string using the KaTeX library. returns The function `computedKatex()` returns a string that is the rendered version of the KaTeX expression stored in the `katex` attribute of the current node. The KaTeX expression is first purified using a method called `replaceKatexSigns()` from a mixin called `mixinConvertToTiptap`, and then rendered using the `katex.renderToString()` function with some options.

```javascript
computedKatex() {
            const purifiedKatex = mixinConvertToTiptap.methods.replaceKatexSigns(this.node.attrs.katex.toString())
            this.checkMathLivePanelVisibility(purifiedKatex)
            return katex.renderToString(purifiedKatex, {
                throwOnError: false,
                safe: true,
                trust: true
            })
        }     
```
## overrideKeyboardEvent

The code is overriding the default behavior of the keyboard events (keydown and keyup)
for the Ctrl key (keyCode 17) and preventing their propagation. It is also keeping track of
whether the key is currently pressed down or not using an object called keyIsDown. The code
is intended to be used as a helper function for other code that needs to handle keyboard
events in a specific way.

```javascript
overrideKeyboardEvent () {
            window.document.onkeydown = overrideKeyboardEvent
            window.document.onkeyup = overrideKeyboardEvent
            const keyIsDown = {}

            function overrideKeyboardEvent(e) {
                if (e.keyCode !== 17) {
                    return
                }
                switch (e.type) {
                    case 'keydown':
                        if (!keyIsDown[e.keyCode]) {
                            keyIsDown[e.keyCode] = true
                            // do key down stuff here
                        }
                        break
                    case 'keyup':
                        delete (keyIsDown[e.keyCode])
                        // do key up stuff here
                        break
                }
                disabledEventPropagation(e)
                e.preventDefault()
                return false
            }
            function disabledEventPropagation(e) {
                if (e) {
                    if (e.stopPropagation) {
                        e.stopPropagation()
                    } else if (window.event) {
                        window.event.cancelBubble = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }  
```

## getKatexErrors()

The above code is a method called `getKatexErrors()` in JavaScript. It renders a LaTeX
string using the KaTeX library and checks for any errors in the rendered output. If there
are any errors, it sets a flag `hasError` to true and logs the error message to the console.
The method also includes some commented out code that could be used to display an error
notification to the user.

```javascript
getKatexErrors() {
            let hasError = false
            const katexString = katex.renderToString(this.katex.toString(), {
                throwOnError: false,
                safe: true,
                trust: true
            })
            const el = document.createElement('div')
            el.innerHTML = katexString
            el.querySelectorAll('.katex-error').forEach(error => { 
              ...
            })
            return hasError
        }       
```

## toggleEdit()

The code is defining a function called `toggleEdit` in JavaScript. This function
toggles the `editMode` property of the object it is called on and checks if there are any
errors in the KaTeX (a typesetting library) being used. If there are errors, it sets
`editMode` to true. Finally, it focuses on the editor, and on update method in editor will be called.

```javascript
toggleEdit () {
            this.editMode = !this.editMode
            if (this.doesKatexHaveErrors()) {
                this.editMode = true
            }
            this.editor.chain().focus().run()
        }    
```

## setKatexShortkeys()

This function sets keyboard shortcuts for inserting certain characters and executing commands in a math editor.

param ev - The event object that contains information about the keyboard event that triggered the function.

param mf - The "mf" parameter is likely an abbreviation for "mathfield", which is a type of input field used for entering mathematical expressions. It is likely an object that provides methods for interacting with the mathfield, such as inserting text or executing commands.



```javascript
setKatexShortkeys (ev, mf) {
            const keyCode = ev.code
            let keystroke = ''
            if (ev.ctrlKey) {
                keystroke += 'ctrl+'
            }
            if (ev.altKey) {
                keystroke += 'alt+'
            }
            if (ev.shiftKey) {
                keystroke += 'shift+'
            }
            ...
        }    
```
