## TiptapInteractiveKatex

As in tiptap documentation for [Interactive node views](https://tiptap.dev/guide/node-views/vue) TiptapInteractiveKatex.vue has the node-view-wrapper for the `VueNodeViewRenderer()` method in `Node.create({})`

also the `MixinComponentFormula` is being used here which comes from the core package. [see docs of mixin](/corePackage/formula/mixin.md)
